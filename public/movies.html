    <h1>The best movies according to Kevin</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr></hr>
    <h3>The intern</h3>
    <p>This is a chill simple movie but it's relaxing and has a lot of truth in it.
        There is humor but also a lot of sentimental parts in it. I love watching it when I need to relax.

    <h3>terminator 2</h3>
    <p>The best of all the terminator movies</p>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>This is one of the best movies ever. It builds up perfectly, it has a very nice musical touch and the story is amazing.</p>
